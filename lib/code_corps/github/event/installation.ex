  Handles an "Installation" GitHub Webhook event. The event could be
  of subtype "created" or "deleted". Only the "created" variant is handled at
  the moment.

  `InstallationCrreated::added` will first try to find the `User` and the
  `GithubAppInstallation`, using information from the payload.
    - if neither are found, it will
      - create a fresh `GithubAppInstallation`, with status "unmatched_user"
    - if only the `User` is found, it will
      - create `GithubAppInstallation` with status "initiated_on_github",
        associated with the `User`
    - if both are found, it will
      - fetch repositories for the installation, create `GithubRepo` records
      - mark installation as processed
    - find `GithubAppInstallation`
      - marks event as errored if not found
      - marks event as errored if payload does not have keys it needs, meaning
        there's something wrong with our code and we need to updated
    - find or create `GithubRepo` records affected

    At the end of the process, the associated event will me marked as
    "processed". If any failure occurs, the event will be marked as "errored".

    Potential points of failure:
    - the installation is found, but the user is not
    - problem communicating with the API
    - the payload received is not of the expected structure
    - the action type is not one of the supported types ("created")
