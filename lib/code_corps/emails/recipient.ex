  From the provided record, builds a valid SparkPost recipient

  See https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/recipient-lists.html#header-address-attributes

  Though SparkPost specifies the address could also be a string type, containing
  just the email, it's simpler to always treat it as a map, so that is what we
  do.
