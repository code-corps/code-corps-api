# Group Slugged Routes

A slugged route is a unique slug that resolves at the root of any request to `codecorps.org`. For the URI `codecorps.org/code-corps`, for example, `code-corps` is the slug that represents the slugged route.

Slugged routes allow us to make API requests for a user or an organization without knowing their `id` in advance. This is particularly useful on the web when the first request may be to a user's profile or an organization's page.

## Slugged Routes [/:slug]

### Find a Slugged Route [GET]

This endpoint will return one of two possible responses, depending on if the slugged route's owner is a user or an organization. If the slugged route is owned by a user, the responses's owner relationship will point to a user and include a user resource. If it's owned by an organization, it will point to and include an organization resource.

# Group User Categories

This resource identifies a relationship between a User and a Category. For example, the category of "Society" may belong to a given user.

We use those interests to match users up to relevant organizations and projects. The term "category" is more appropriate for _categorizing_ those organizations and projects.
