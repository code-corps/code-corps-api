# API Reference

The Code Corps API is a [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)-based REST API built in Elixir. You can visit the [API project on GitHub](https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-api).

This API is intended for direct consumption by the Code Corps Ember application.

The production API can be found at `https://api.codecorps.org`.

The staging API can be found at `http://api.pbqrpbecf.org`.

The remote development API can be found at `http://api.pbqrpbecf-qri.org`.

# Group Slugged Routes

A slugged route is a unique slug that resolves at the root of any request to `codecorps.org`. For the URI `codecorps.org/code-corps`, for example, `code-corps` is the slug that represents the slugged route.

Slugged routes allow us to make API requests for a user or an organization without knowing their `id` in advance. This is particularly useful on the web when the first request may be to a user's profile or an organization's page.

## Slugged Routes [/:slug]

### Retrieve a slugged route [GET]

This endpoint will return one of two possible responses, depending on if the slugged route's owner is a user or an organization. If the slugged route is owned by a user, the responses's owner relationship will have a user relationship and a nil organization relationship. If it's owned by an organization, it will have an organization relationship and a nil user relationship.

# Group Tasks

## Project Tasks [/projects/{project_id}/tasks]

You can list all tasks or retrieve individual tasks for a single project.

### List all of a project's tasks [GET]

+ Parameters

    + project_id (number) - Id of a project.

+ Request

    + Headers

            Accept: application/vnd.api+json

+ Response 200 (application/vnd.api+json; charset=utf-8)

    + Attributes (Tasks Response)

## Project Task [/projects/{project_id}/tasks/{number}]

### Retrieve a project's task [GET]

The `number` parameter in this endpoint is notably different from the usual `id`. Because the front-end Ember application loads a URL with the task's `number` (scoped to the project) for human readability, we don't actually know the `id`. The request is made with the `number` instead.

This allows us to have a logical numbering scheme for the project rather than extremely long `id`s.

+ Parameters

    + project_id (number) - Id of a project.
    + number (number) - The `number` of a task.

+ Request

    + Headers

            Accept: application/vnd.api+json
