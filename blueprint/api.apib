# API Reference

The Code Corps API is a [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)-based REST API built in Elixir. You can visit the [API project on GitHub](https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-api).

This document outlines how to interact with the API's resource-oriented URLs. JSON API errors returned by the API are also documented along with their HTTP status codes.

This API is intended for direct consumption by the Code Corps Ember application.

The production API can be found at `https://api.codecorps.org`.

The staging API can be found at `http://api.pbqrpbecf.org`.

The remote development API can be found at `http://api.pbqrpbecf-qri.org`.

# Group Github App Installations

This endpoint is used for creating, updating, and retrieving information about a GitHub App installation. See the GitHub API documentation for more details about [the installation process of GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-a-new-integration/about-choosing-an-integration-type/#installation-processes-for-integrations).

To simplify, Code Corps has a GitHub App which is installed to a GitHub user's or GitHub organization's account _on GitHub_. This grants Code Corps read and write access to the GitHub API on behalf of that user or organization.

You'll notice project and user relationships, which are only useful when setting up an installation for the first time. When GitHub redirects the user back to Code Corps after installing the GitHub App, our client only has access to the installation's `installation_id` in a query parameter. Because of this, before we direct the user to GitHub to install our App, we need to create a GithubAppInstallation record that keeps track of the user who requested it, the project it was requested on. This installation will be automatically marked with the `state` set to `"unprocessed"` and the `origin` set to `"codecorps"`.

Note that this does not mean there's actually an installation yet! The user hasn't been to GitHub. We're just keeping track of that installation for later.

Once the user installs the App on GitHub, GitHub will send an `installation` webhook to our API. The payload includes a `sender` key containing the GitHub account (along with its `id`) that performed the installation. The user is then automatically redirected back to Code Corps.

Once the user is back on Code Corps, we want to redirect the user back to the target project. Luckily, the `installation_id` GitHub provided in the query parameter yields enough information to match it to our authenticated user's GithubAppInstallation record created in the previous step.

We match:
  - the `installation_id` in the query parameter
  - the `installation` webhook's `installation_id` and `sender`'s account `id`
  - our user's GitHub account `id`

These pieces of information are enough to tell us who installed the application. And because we stored the target project for this first installation, we can redirect our user. The API may need to do some processing work to complete the setup, but once the `state` has moved to `processed`, the client can redirect to the project's integrations page using the project relationship.

Keep in mind that an installation could be used across multiple projects. And because an installation can be installed at the _organization_ level on GitHub, that means the user who requested the installation is likely not be the only user with permissions on GitHub to modify or even uninstall the GitHub App. The user relationship specified here is _only_ useful for the first installation of a user on a project, due solely to the complicated redirection flow detailed above.

# Group Project Github Repos

This resource identifies a relationship between a Project and a GitHub repository. This relationship indicates whether the project is connected to a particular repository on GitHub and listening for events on that repository (like an issue being created). This is essential for the operation of the GitHub integration for syncing new issues and comments from GitHub to Code Corps.

For example, the project "Code Corps" may have the GitHub repositories of "code-corps-api" and "code-corps-ember" syncing with the project's tasks _on Code Corps itself_.

The organization owner can update their projects by connecting or disconnecting GitHub repositories that are available under their GitHub App installation. This will create or delete the Project Github Repo records, respectively.

# Group Slugged Routes

A slugged route is a unique slug that resolves at the root of any request to `codecorps.org`. For the URI `codecorps.org/code-corps`, for example, `code-corps` is the slug that represents the slugged route for the Organization `Code Corps` with the `slug` of `code-corps`.

Slugged routes allow us to make API requests for a user or an organization without knowing their `id` in advance. This is particularly useful on the web when the first request may be to a user's profile or an organization's page.

## Slugged Routes [/:slug]

### Retrieve a slugged route [GET]

This endpoint will return one of two possible responses, depending on if the slugged route's owner is a user or an organization.

If the slugged route is owned by a user, the responses will contain a `user` relationship and a `nil` `organization` relationship.

If the slugged route is owned by an organization, the responses will contain an `organization` relationship and a `nil` `user` relationship.

# Group Tasks

## Project Tasks [/projects/{project_id}/tasks]

You can list all tasks or retrieve individual tasks for a single project.

### List all of a project's tasks [GET]

+ Parameters

    + project_id (number) - Id of a project.

+ Request

    + Headers

            Accept: application/vnd.api+json

+ Response 200 (application/vnd.api+json; charset=utf-8)

    + Attributes (Tasks Response)

## Project Task [/projects/{project_id}/tasks/{number}]

### Retrieve a project's task [GET]

The `number` parameter in this endpoint is notably different from the usual `id`. Because the front-end Ember application loads a URL with the task's `number` (scoped to the project) for human readability, we don't actually know the `id`. The request is made with the `number` instead.

This allows us to have a logical numbering scheme for the project rather than extremely long `id`s.

+ Parameters

    + project_id (number) - Id of a project.
    + number (number) - The `number` of a task.

+ Request

    + Headers

            Accept: application/vnd.api+json

# Group User Categories

This resource identifies a relationship between a User and a Category. For example, the category of "Society" may belong to a given user.

It may help to think of a User Category as an interest. A user may have interests in "Society", "Technology" and "Government". We use those interests to match users up to relevant projects. The term "category" is more appropriate for _categorizing_ those projects.

# Group Webhooks - Stripe

Code Corps responds to [Stripe webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks).

Since Code Corps is a platform, we have two separate webhook endpoints for dealing with both Stripe Connect (the custom accounts) and the platform (shared data across customers).

## Stripe Connect Webhook [/webhooks/stripe/connect]

Handles Stripe Connect events for custom accounts for projects on the Code Corps platform.

This endpoint provides information about the actual payments and subscriptions that occur on the custom accounts.

### Stripe Connect Webhook [POST]

+ Request

    + Attributes

        + object - The Stripe object.

    + Headers

            Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

+ Response 400 (application/vnd.api+json; charset=utf-8)

## Stripe Platform Webhook [/webhooks/stripe/platform]

Handles Stripe events for the Code Corps platform itself.

The platform stores Stripe customers and cards so they can be reused across different projects, and fan out updates to all the managed custom Stripe accounts.

### Stripe Platform Webhook [POST]

+ Request

    + Attributes

        + object - The Stripe object.

    + Headers
