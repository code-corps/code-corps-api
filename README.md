This is the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) backend API for [codecorps.org](https://www.codecorps.org).

Code Corps is an open source platform for building and funding public software with massive social impact.

Our goals:

- **Connect people** - Match developers and designers, project managers and marketers – any and every talent – to ambitious projects that need their help.
- **Provide support** - Educate and train, develop and encourage people who build public software. Help projects be successful and people to do their best work.
- **Fund projects** - Crowdfund ongoing work and keep funders engaged in projects and connected to the teams they're supporting.
- **Develop new tools** - Help people collaborate on, organize, and even distribute their work. Listen closely to hear what needs built, and then build it.
